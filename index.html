title: "About Me"
---

I am a second-year PhD student in the Biology department at Stanford University, where I am coadvised by [Dmitri Petrov](http://petrov.stanford.edu) and [Jonas Cremer](https://cremerlab.github.io). I am broadly interested in how complex systems process information and make decisions in dynamically changing environments. I combine tools from mathematical modeling, computation, microbiology, and molecular biology to interrogate these questions. I am funded by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.

My undergraduate and masters research was advised by [Van Savage](https://vsavage.faculty.biomath.ucla.edu). In the Savage Lab I worked on two projects, the first on alternative segmentation and labelling schemes for resource distribution networks and the second on the relationship between cell size and antibiotic susceptibility, together with [Chris Kempes](http://chriskempes.com/Chris_Kempes/Home.html) and [Pamela Yeh](https://faculty.eeb.ucla.edu/Yeh/index.html). I also conducted research at the Santa Fe institute over the Summer of 2019, where I was mentored by Chris Kempes. 

I am also very interested in animal rights and the link between food systems and climate change and am part of the Stanford Alt. Protein Club. I am also part of the wonderful Stanford Womxn's Ultimate Frisbee team (Firefly)!
