<h3> Evolution and fitness of <i> S. cerevisiae </i> in fluctuating environments </h3>
<p>
  I'm interested in the physiological and evolutionary consequences of fluctuating environments. Check out our paper (led by Dr. Clare Abreu) now out in Nature Ecology and Evolution <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02475-9"> here</a>! My ongoing work focuses on characterizing the length and nature of environmental memory in yeast.

<h3> Natural variaiton and resource Allocation in Fluctuating Environments </h3>
<p>
  Using models and experimental techniques, I am studying how yeast natural isolates allocate resources in fluctuating conditions, particularly in the context of the carbon hierarchy.

<h3> Combinatorics of Phylogenetic Trees </h3>
<p>
   In my rotation in the Rosenberg lab we <a href="https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-023-00224-4"> generalized an algorithm to count the labeleld histories (a useful mathematical property of phylogenetic networks) for phylogenetic trees to galled trees</a>, a class of phylogenetic networks.
