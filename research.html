<h3> Evolution of Anticipation in <i> S. cerevisiae </i> </h3>
<p>
  I'm studying the evolution of anticipatory behavior using DNA-barcoded <i> S. cerevisiae </i> in the Petrov Lab (in collaboration with Clare Abreu).

<h3> Resource Allocation in Fluctuating Environments </h3>
<p>
  Using models and experimental techniques, I am studying how microbes allocate resources in fluctuating conditions.

<h3> Counting the Number of Labelled Histories in Galled Trees </h3>
<p>
   In my rotation in the Rosenberg lab we generalized an algorithm to count the labeleld histories (a useful mathematical property of phylogenetic networks) for phylogenetic trees to galled trees, a class of phylogenetic networks.
