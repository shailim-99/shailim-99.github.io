<h3> Evolution and fitness of <i> S. cerevisiae </i> in fluctuating environments </h3>
<p>
  I'm studying the evolution of DNA-barcoded <i> S. cerevisiae </i> to fluctuating environments in the Petrov Lab, particularly the evolution to directional transitions in three-environment cycles (in collaboration with Dr. Clare Abreu).

<h3> Resource Allocation in Fluctuating Environments </h3>
<p>
  Using models and experimental techniques, I am studying how microbes allocate resources in fluctuating conditions, particularly in the context of the carbon hierarchy.

<h3> Counting the Number of Labelled Histories in Galled Trees </h3>
<p>
   In my rotation in the Rosenberg lab we generalized an algorithm to count the labeleld histories (a useful mathematical property of phylogenetic networks) for phylogenetic trees to galled trees, a class of phylogenetic networks. <a href="https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-023-00224-4"> Our paper </a> "All galls are divided into three or more parts: recursive enumeration of labeled histories for galled trees" is now out in <em> Algorithms for Molecular Biology<em>!
